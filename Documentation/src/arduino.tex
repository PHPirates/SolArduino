\section{Changing ip address}


To change IP address, change it in the Arduino code two times (\verb|myip| en \verb|gw|), if needed also change the NAS ip adress:
\begin{lstlisting}
    ether.hisip[0]=192;
    ether.hisip[1]=168;
    ether.hisip[2]=178;
    ether.hisip[3]=29;
\end{lstlisting}
and the dns (directly under it).

It may be needed to find the right dns for the NAS and the gw (gateway) address again, by doing a normal dhcp setup like
\begin{lstlisting}
    ether.dhcpSetup();
    ether.printIp("IP: ", ether.myip);
    ether.printIp("GW: ", ether.gwip);
    ether.printIp("DNS: ", ether.dnsip);
    ether.printIp("SRV: ", ether.hisip);
\end{lstlisting}
Do not change the dns for the NTP server, \verb|dns[] = {195,121,1,34}|, otherwise the NTP dns lookup fails.
