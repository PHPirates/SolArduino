NanodeMAC

Original sketch at https://gist.github.com/1020951

Library version created by Andrew Lindsay for use with Nanode and 
EtherShield Library at https://github.com/thiseldo/EtherShield

Based on sample code to read the MAC address from the 11AA02E48 on the
back of the Nanode V5 board.

This code is hacky and basic - it doesn't check for bus errors
and will probably fail horribly if it's interrupted. It's best
run in setup() - fetch the MAC address once and keep it. After
the address is fetched, it puts the chip back in standby mode
in which it apparently only consumes 1uA.

Feel free to reuse this code - suggestions for improvement are
welcome! :)

BITS    7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
PORTD = D7  D6  D5  D4  D3  D2  D1  D0
PORTB = -   -   D13 D12 D11 D10 D9  D8

Nanode has UNI/O SCIO on DIG7


To use the library:

#include <NanodeMAC.h>

static uint8_t mymac[6] = { 0,0,0,0,0,0 };
NanodeMAC mac( mymac );

Then wherever mymac is used, the value will be the one from the chip.
