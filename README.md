* [Arduino code](https://github.com/PHPirates/SolArduino/raw/master/SolArduino_atom/SolArduino/SolArduino.ino)
* Mathematica calculations, the package file is [here](https://github.com/PHPirates/SolArduino/raw/master/Documentation/Mathematica/SolArduino.m) and there is also a package [demonstration](https://github.com/PHPirates/SolArduino/raw/master/Documentation/Mathematica/demonstration.nb) notebook.
* Android app, find the apk [here](https://github.com/PHPirates/SolArduino/raw/master/solappduino/solarduino/app/build/outputs/apk/app-debug.apk).
* Desktop app, source code [here](https://github.com/PHPirates/SolArduino/tree/master/SolArduino-desktop/src/SolArduino), executables soon coming.
